February 2019, New York—SLI Communication worked with New York Fashion Week China Day to build brand awareness.
</p>
<p>
To fully extend the concept and attract more interaction and engagement from Chinese young generations, SLI Communication designed 3 communication paths for China Day: 1) top-tier fashion media to boost buzz for China Day; 2) fashion we-media to share in-depth observation about Chinese fashion brand; 3) social influencers and bloggers leading viral topic “Youth made China”.
</p>
<p>
During New York Fashion Week China Day, top-tier fashion media such as COSMO, Grazia released exposure on official social media account; social influencers post photos of the fashion cat walk with # Youth made China; thousands of people reposted and give supportive comments; even many celebrities joined the social discussion. 
</p>
<p>
Eventually, we generated more than 23 million views and more than 40,000 engagements on social media.
