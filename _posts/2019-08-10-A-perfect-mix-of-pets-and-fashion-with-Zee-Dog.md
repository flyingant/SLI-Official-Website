<h1>Pet Meets Fashion: A perfect mix of pets and fashion with Zee Dog</h1>

Zee Dog is a mature and fashionable pet brand originating from Brazil. To better connect dogs and people they create an attachment to pet accessories, giving their products an aesthetic lacking from their competitors. The material and designs are made to be comfortable for dogs, preventing them from rubbing or damaging the wearers skin. Additionally they treat dogs as individuals with their colourful patterns setting them out from the rest. The inspiration for these colour schemes comes from a variety of places from the tropical rainforest, to the sunny beach. The colours and patterns are very modern and fashionable. In comparison to most products on the Chinese market, the product design is very warm and clean, and has its own clear brand personality and identity.

SLI provided a creative communication idea: Pets Meet Fashion. We leveraged fashion media instead of the usual pet media this time to promote Zee Dog. This allowed us to access a much larger market than conventional pet media marketing would allow.

SLI contacted more than 20 fashion bloggers who have dogs, including those who have millions of followers on Weibo. They could bring their pets to join the dinner where they were provided carefully selected gifts from different Zee Dog collections for each pet: according to the pets’ size, breed and gender.

SLI conducted an interview with CEO Felipe Diz for the various media representatives present. This enabled him to share his vision for the future of Zee Dog. SLI distributed the interview to COSMO GRAZIA and other top tier fashion media to maximise views.
