June 2019, Shanghai —- SLI Communications work with Furbo on a series of blogger initiatives.

Furbo is a pet specialist brand, they are best known for pet cameras which allow owners to keep an eye on pets whilst out of the house as well as automatic treat dispensers. Sensors on the dispenser and a smartphone app allow the owner to know when the pet is nearby. Their camera is currently the number 1 best selling camera on Amazon.

SLI were enlisted by Furbo to assist in building it’s market share and awareness in the Chinese market. Furbo required premium content made by bloggers, to aid this SLI carefully selected luxury and fashion bloggers who are known to have pet dogs to advertise the product and increase awareness.

All the bloggers were given clear instructions through SLI to ensure that the quality measures for photos required by Furbo were met, as well as giving the impression of a high quality brand. As a result all the blogger content was clean, warm and fully showcased Furbo’s brand values.
