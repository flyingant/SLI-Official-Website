September 2018, Shanghai â€” As November is the hot season for Chinese to travel to Australia, the Melbourne Cup Carnival approached SLI to launch a private event targeting these visitors.
</p>
<p>
SLI helped Melbourne Cup Carnival to launch an exclusive VIP event and provided full support through event design, venue set-up, guest invitation and media promotion.
</p>
<p>
As Fashion show is always a big highlight during the horse racing event, SLI collaborated with fashion brand Peony Rice to provide dresses and hats to display on site so that guests could try on the hats. SLI also invited several Australian companies to join a panel discussion to provide in-depth insights of trip to Australia to further promote Melbourne Cup Carnival amongst attendees.
</p>
<p>
On this event, SLI invited 40+ HNWI guests attended and gained more than 3,000 social media engagements. All the guests gave positive feedback of this event.
