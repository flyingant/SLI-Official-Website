October 2018, Shanghai —- SLI Communications assist Luxembourg for Finance China Mission, supporting the 80 person delegation lead by Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna and Luxembourg for Finance CEO Nicolas Mackel to prepare all their events.

Luxembourg for Finance is one of the top 3 Green Finance Centres worldwide and the top financial organisation in Luxembourg, providing financial security to other large financial institutions.

During the 2018 Luxembourg for Finance China Mission, SLI was approached to organise seminars and workshops in Shanghai and Beijing for Chinese financial professionals. The registration for these events was arranged by SLI providing IT support to ensure approval for individuals attending the events.

The delegation gave various speeches during the seminars which SLI ensured were attended by the top financial media to maximise the coverage of benefits that could be provided, as well as introducing their products to the investors present.

Further supporting Luxembourg for Finance, SLI invited top tier business and financial media to perform an interview with the Finance minister and CEO of LFF, including more than 20 members of the state media and commercial business media, including CCTV, CBN, International finance new, Phenix TV, and more.

As a result of SLI’s assistance, Luxembourg for Finance gained large scale exposure with more than 100 forms of Chinese media; meanwhile, more than 500 finance professionals

were attracted to join the seminars in both Beijing and Shanghai further increasing their reach.
