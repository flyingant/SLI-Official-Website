May 2019, Shanghai —SLI Communication supported tcworld’s fifth international conference for technical communicators in China.
</p>
<p>
As tech communication is not widely recognized or used in China so there is a large potential for the technology to be used. SLI’s role in the conference was to increase the knowledge of tcworld to more Chinese companies. 
</p>
<p>
At tcworld China 2019, local and international TC experts shared their experiences and best practices with solutions for China-specific challenges, to exchange the latest information in the Technical Communication industry. 
</p>
<p>
On this event, SLI suggested 3 speakers to conduct media interviews, including the CEO of tcworld Michael Fritz, Tong ji university professor Li Mei, and a member of senior leadership from a top Chinese e-commerce platform, to discuss potential uses and growth for tech communication in China and how to improve training and increase the value to business.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, we had more than 10 business and tech media reported this event.
