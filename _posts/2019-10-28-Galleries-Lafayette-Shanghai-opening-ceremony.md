France’s leading fashion department store, Galeries Lafayette marks the Grand Opening of its new Shanghai flagship at L+Mall in Pudong with its “Let’s Celebrate Fashion” campaign – a series of exciting fashion experiences with exclusive product launches, creative concepts and in-store events. 
</p>
<p>
Galeries Lafayette brings Paris to Shanghai by transforming its Shanghai department store into distinctive Parisian streets along with other traditional features of the city of romance – from the Parisian walk-in store to the Eiffel Tower and Bistrot – that are subtly displayed with a creative twist by the internationally-acclaimed French illustrator and graffiti artist André Saraiva.

We supported Galeries Lafayette with media invitation and execution of media tour in the afternoon. We invited more than 50 fashion media, lifestyle media and bloggers to attend the event.
