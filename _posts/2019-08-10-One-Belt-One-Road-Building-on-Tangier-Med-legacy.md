July 2019, Morocco— SLI Communications worked with Tangier Med to gain large scale exposure in top-tier business, financial and investment media and attract Chinese investors.
</p>
<p>
Tangier Med is the largest and perhaps most ambitious logistical infrastructure group in the Africa and Mediterranean area. With easy access to the African and European markets and extensive trade deals, Tangier Med’s port and its expansion is central to their ambitions. SLI helped Tangier Med to prepare press materials and distributed to all the key business and finance media in China. 
</p>
<p>
SLI approached more than 100 business, financial and news media in 2 weeks. As a result, the content is posted on more than 80 media as well as many state media such as the front page of International Finance News.
