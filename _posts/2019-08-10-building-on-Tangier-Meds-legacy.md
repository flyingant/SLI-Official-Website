July, 2019, Shanghai— SLI Communications builds connections through large scale exposure in top-tier financial and investment media.

Tangier Med is the largest and perhaps most ambitious logistical infrastructure group in the Africa and Mediterranean area. Reporting to the Moroccan government they are responsible for a significant part of Morocco’s infrastructure, as well as running a large industrial base and tax free area around Tangier. With easy access to the African and European markets and extensive trade deals, Tangier Med’s port and its expansion is central to their ambitions.

Aligning with the Port expansion to raise their shipping capacity into the global top 10, SLI Communications provided Tangier Med with the services to become a key a feature of the one belt, one road initiative.

SLI Communications were briefed to review the best methods to maximise exposure amongst potential Chinese and South East Asian investors.

In line with this briefing SLI approached more than 80 different members of the business, financial and news media community to create an excitement around the project and it’s ambitions. The result of these efforts were articles in many of the major publications, and even the front page of International Finance News.

To provide the information that these media players wanted, SLI produced a series of interviews to create an executive review of the project and it’s vision. As well as providing an interview with a Chinese company running out of Tangier Med’s industrial zone, giving a growing insight of the project with the benefits and experiences they have gained providing the back drop.

SLI increased Tangier Med’s renown within the target market of Chinese investors ensuring that it is in the investors psyche well into the future.
