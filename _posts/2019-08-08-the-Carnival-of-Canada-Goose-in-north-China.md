<h1>A sales magic: the Carnival of Canada Goose in north China</h1>

Canada Goose is a luxury brand in high demand among China’s affluent shoppers. Seeing the bright outlook, the brand embarked on an aggressive expansion into the market; opening its regional head office in Shanghai in March and launching on Alibaba’s Tmall platform in the fall.

The CEO of Canada Goose Dani Reiss once said, there is only one chance to enter the Chinese market, means it has to be very carefully planned. In this case, SLI was given the task of organising the main event to signify Canada Goose’s entry into the market. To fulfil this target SLI deigned a 10-day experience for Canada Goose to build anticipation for the brand.

SLI organised a grand celebration on the first night. Celebrity He Sui and Li Zhi Ting joined the event, SLI invited more than 100 members of the media and bloggers to join the event, to see and feel the new collection, and widely boost the buzz and the attention received on social media.

For the next 10 days after the grand celebration, SLI invited each blogger to bring 20 followers to visit the venue together. Canada goose staff would give each of them an exclusive tour. This increased the buzz around Canada Goose’s entry into the market and provide a large amount of free social media coverage.
