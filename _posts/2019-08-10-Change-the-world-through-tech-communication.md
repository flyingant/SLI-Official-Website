May 2019, Shanghai —SLI Communication support tcworld’s fifth international conference for technical communicators and language professionals in China.

At tcworld China 2019, local and international TC experts shared their experiences and best practices with solutions for China-specific challenges, to exchange the latest information in the Technical Communication industry.

SLI’s role in the conference was to increase the knowledge of tcworld to the general populace. Tech communication is not widely recognised or used in China so there is a large potential for the technology to be used.

To further increase knowledge of Technical Communication SLI selected 3 speakers from among more than 50 at the conference to conduct media interviews, including the CEO of tcworld Michael Fritz, Tong ji university professor Li Mei, and a member of senior leadership from a top Chinese e-commerece platform, to discuss potential uses and growth for tech communication in China, how to improve training and increase the value to business.
