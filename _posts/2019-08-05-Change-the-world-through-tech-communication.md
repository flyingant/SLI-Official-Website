<p>
At tcworld China 2019, local and international TC experts shared their experiences and best practices with solutions for China-specific challenges, to exchange the latest information in the Technical Communication industry.
</p>
<p>
SLI’s role in the conference was to increase the knowledge of tcworld to the general populace. Tech communication is not widely recognised or used in China so there is a large potential for the technology to be used.
</p>
<p>
To further increase knowledge of Technical Communication SLI selected 3 speakers from among more than 50 at the conference to conduct media interviews, including the CEO of tcworld Michael Fritz, Tong ji university professor Li Mei, and a member of senior leadership from a top Chinese e-commerece platform, to discuss potential uses and growth for tech communication in China, how to improve training and increase the value to business.
