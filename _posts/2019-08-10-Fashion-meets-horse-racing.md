September, 2018, Shanghai —SLI Communications work with Melbourne Cup Carnival for an exclusive VIP event to promote the horse racing event among Chinese high net wealth individual demographic.

The Melbourne Cup Carnival is a major horse racing event in Australia, where the tastes of the attendees are clearly on display be it fashion or socialising.

As November is the hot season for Chinese to travel to Australia, the Melbourne Cup Carnival approached SLI to launch a private event targeting these visitors. SLI provided full support through event design, venue set-up, guest invitation and media promotion.

The Fashion show is always a big highlight during the horse racing event, SLI collaborated with a customisable fashion brand - Peony Rice, to provide dresses and hats to display on site, so guests could visit the venue, view and try on the clothes.

SLI also invited several Australian companies to join a panel discussion to provide in-depth insights, including an Australian wine brand, hotel brand, and travel agency to share their
opinions of customised travel plans —-better experience, more contact with local people and local events, to further promote Melbourne Cup Carnival.
