klee klee is the environmental-friendly fashion brand belonging to the ZUG ZUG group. In their new collection launch cat walk show, models showcased the new collection made of
cotton, wool and other natural materials. To truly display the environmental-friendly concept, the venue was also set-up using environmental-friendly materials, based on the green-and- white colour scheme, all of the materials used in the event will be recycled to make small gifts for each guest.

During the manufacturing process, klee klee kept the original material colour to reduce pollution, but to also create high-quality clothing which has a natural glow, making it easier to wear in daily life, and more healthy for the human body.

Based on this environmental-friendly concept, SLI Communications invited fashion and lifestyle media and bloggers as guests for this outdoor cat walk show in the spring. SLI also pitched several interviews with lifestyle media such as LOHAS to have an in-depth discussion with klee klee’s chief designer, about the inspiration, design ideas, and future plans for the new collections design.

SLI’s team greeted guests at the entrance making them feel valued and welcome at the event. The attendees and the venue’s set-up perfectly represented klee klee’s brand concept. klee klee would rather call the event a friendly gathering instead of a formal cat walk show; moreover, only half of the models are professional, the others are individuals who love the klee klee brand, and appear as confident, independent people, wearing klee klee in their own daily life.
