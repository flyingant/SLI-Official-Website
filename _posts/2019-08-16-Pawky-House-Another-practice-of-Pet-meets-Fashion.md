June 2019, Shanghai—SLI worked with Pawky House on the pop-up store. 
</p>
<p>
During this event, Pawky House showcased this new collection with inspiration from Africa. To leverage the experience in fashion industry. To help Pawky House to reveal the pet brand’s ambition, SLI invited blogger and media to visit the pop-up store and take photos. We also pitch top-tier news media Shanghaiwow for an interview with founder of Pawky House.
